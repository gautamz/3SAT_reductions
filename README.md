# 3SAT Reductions
I plan to host code here for reductions from 3SAT to Hamiltonian Cycle, 3 Dimensional Matching, Set Cover, 3-Coloring, Subset Sum and Subset Product.
Write now the repo has -
1) A file to load a 3SAT/3CNF instance stored in a .dimacs file
2) Code for reducing 3CNF to Hamiltonian Cycle

# TODO
1) 3SAT > 3 Dimensional Matching
2) 3SAT > Set Cover
3) 3SAT > Exact 3 Cover
4) 3SAT > Subset Product
5) 3SAT > 3 Coloring
6) 3SAT > Subset Sum
7) Plotting the output of the reductions graphically, where possible.
